    "A t-test and a z-test are both statistical tests used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data. They are typically used to test hypotheses about means or proportions, but they have different applications and assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **T-Test**:\n",
    "   - **Use Case**: The t-test is used when you are working with a small sample (typically less than 30) and when the population standard deviation is unknown. It is especially suitable when dealing with samples from populations that do not follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "   - **Assumption**: Assumes that the sample data follows a normal distribution or is approximately normally distributed.\n",
    "   - **Formula**: The t-test calculates the t-statistic using the sample mean, the population mean (or the hypothesized mean), the sample standard deviation, and the sample size.\n",
    "   - **Example Scenario**: You might use a t-test to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in the average test scores between two groups of 15 students each, where the standard deviation of the test scores for both groups is unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Z-Test**:\n",
    "   - **Use Case**: The z-test is used when you have a larger sample size (typically more than 30) and when the population standard deviation is known. It is suitable for situations where you have a sample from a population with a known normal distribution or a sample size large enough for the Central Limit Theorem to apply.\n",
    "   - **Assumption**: Assumes that the sample data follows a normal distribution or is approximately normally distributed, and you know the population standard deviation.\n",
    "   - **Formula**: The z-test calculates the z-statistic using the sample mean, the population mean (or the hypothesized mean), the population standard deviation, and the sample size.\n",
    "   - **Example Scenario**: You might use a z-test to determine if a new manufacturing process has significantly changed the mean weight of a product when you have a sample of 100 products, and you know the population standard deviation of the product weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the choice between a t-test and a z-test depends on your sample size and whether you know the population standard deviation. If the population standard deviation is unknown and you have a small sample, a t-test is more appropriate. If you have a large sample and know the population standard deviation or are working with a known normal distribution, a z-test is often used."

    "2. **Hypotheses**: In a one-tailed test, you have two hypotheses:\n",

    "1. **Directionality**: A two-tailed test is used when you do not have a specific hypothesis about the direction of the effect, and you want to test whether there is a significant difference in either direction (greater than or less than) from a certain value.\n",

    "2. **Hypotheses**: In a two-tailed test, you also have two hypotheses:\n",
    "   - **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: This still states that there is no effect or no difference, and it typically includes an equality symbol (e.g., μ = 50).\n",

    "In this example, the larger sample size (200 observations) results in a smaller margin of error (0.98 seconds) compared to the smaller sample size (50 observations) with a larger margin of error (1.39 seconds).\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates how a larger sample size allows you to make a more precise estimate of the population parameter, reducing the margin of error and increasing the confidence in your estimate. Larger sample sizes are generally preferred when precision is important, but they may also be more costly and time-consuming to obtain."
