    "Multiprocessing in Python is a way of running multiple processes simultaneously. A process is a program in execution. Each process has its own memory space, so they can run independently of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing is useful for various reasons:\n",
    "    1. Multiprocessing allows programs to execute tasks in parallel on different CPU cores, taking full advantage of multi-core systems.\n",
    "    2.Each process has its own memory space, which provides strong isolation between processes. \n",
    "    3.processes don't share memory, one misbehaving process is less likely to affect others. If one process crashes, it typically doesn't lead to the entire program crashing.\n",
    "    4.Efficient I/O Handling is the another reason of useful multiprocessing.\n",
    "    5.By spreading tasks across multiple processes, you can make better use of the available hardware resources and reduce the time it takes to complete a set of tasks."
